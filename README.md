# TechAtAgoda #22 : Full Open-Source CI/CD of a dotnet core application (Workshop)

In this session we're going to create and deploy an application end-to-end with software development best practices. This will include:
- Create a dotnet core, React SPA
- Host it in GitHub
- Write some unit tests (C# and TypeScript), just to get some good stuff for the next steps
- Build it in an automated CI
- Get code coverage report in GitHub Pull Request
- Get static code analysis report in GitHub Pull Request
- Get the application health (code smell, code quality...) dashboard
- Deploy it and run it
